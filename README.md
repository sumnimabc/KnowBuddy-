# KnowBuddy

## Purpose & Functionality
KnowBuddy demonstrates how to build a small, memory-enabled ReAct agent. The main script wires an Anthropic Claude model into a LangChain/LangGraph workflow, equips it with a Tavily search tool, and streams responses to user prompts. A minimal `demo.py` is provided as a simple console demo.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain
- LangGraph
- Anthropic's Claude via `ChatAnthropic`
- Tavily search integration
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation

## Next Vision
- Add more tools for expanded capabilities (e.g., calculators, databases)
- Build a user-facing interface for interaction
- Explore deploying agents with open-source models
